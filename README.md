This is the presentation I will give at the Collaborative and Human Aspects of Software Engineering (CHASE) conference in May 2022.

It is built upon the revealjs framework so a big thanks to the people behind that.

The main file is index.html

* Firstly ensure you have node and npm installed onto your machine
* Clone this GitHub repo
